# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App 🍿

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation App, a React web application created with Vite. 🚀

## Purpose

The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate my learnings of Redux Toolkit (RTK) and showcase how to efficiently manage state using Redux. Additionally, this project also showcases my understanding of React navigation using the `react-router` package.

## Features

🎥 **Movie Recommendation Form**: The app features a user-friendly form on the first page, allowing users to recommend their favorite movies. Upon submission, the movie recommendation is saved in the Redux store.

🔥 **Recently Added Recommendations**: The first page also showcases a "Recently Added" section that displays the three most recent movie recommendations from the store. This provides users with quick access to the latest recommendations.

📜 **Movie Recommendations List**: On the second page, the app reads from the Redux store and displays a list of recommended movies. Users can easily browse through the movie recommendations.

🔄 **Clear All Recommendations**: Additionally, the second page includes a button to clear all movie recommendations from the Redux store. This ensures a clean slate for new recommendations.
